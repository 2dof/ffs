Project Summary
===============
Functional Fuzzy System (ffs) is intended to be a very simple library for modeling fuzzy system for
Mamdani and Sugeno inference.


Actual status
----------------
:Version: 1.0.0 dev
:Status:    developing

Done:
+++++
* Implemented basic fuzzy inference engine and fuzzy class structure for only AND,and NOT logic in user-defined rules

To Do:
++++++
* Implementet supprot for OR logic user defined rules, and linguistic Rules definition
* support for normalized parameters and values (integer based computation)
* Docs, Examples
* GUI for building fuzzy inference systems and viewing and analyzing result
* Code optimization and refractoring (port to Cython)
